"""The in-car voice agent loop (the Theme 05 use-case extension).

One ``DriveRuntime`` per car (websocket). It speaks the same frame protocol as
the main agent - stage/token/message/filler/spec/tool/metric/checkpoint - plus
``drive`` (vehicle and route state) and ``drive_event`` (what BACKSPACE did).

What it demonstrates, in the guide's own terms:

* Stay responsive: every request is acknowledged within milliseconds, without
  claiming anything is done ("Checking the route to Jaipur..."), and questions
  are answered even while a route is still being computed.
* Work asynchronously: route planning runs as background work, and starts
  speculatively from *partial* speech, before the user finishes. It is never
  awaited in a way that blocks the next utterance.
* Recover cleanly: the destination, stops and preferences are BACKSPACE facts
  and the route is a WorkItem depending on them. A change mid-flight marks
  the route stale, a late result from the stale attempt is discarded, the
  route is recomputed with the new arguments, and starting navigation goes
  through BACKSPACE's at-most-once commit guard - it never happens twice for
  the same route, and never for an abandoned destination.
* Barge-in: the user can cut in at any point; what they actually heard is
  checkpointed and "go on" resumes from there instead of restarting.
