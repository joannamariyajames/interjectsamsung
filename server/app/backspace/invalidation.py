"""Invalidation result data model, and the invalidation engine built on it.

``Invalidation`` (Phase 2) is what a dependency-graph walk produces for a
given fact change: which work survived, which was invalidated, which claims
went with it, and why. Phase 5 completes it - the walk itself now exists,
built on ``DependencyGraph`` (Phase 4).

The core invariant this file exists to guarantee, stated once here because
every design decision below serves it: **if a fact changes, only work
transitively dependent on that fact may become invalid; everything else must
remain exactly as it was.** ``invalidate()``/``invalidate_many()`` never
touch a WORK or CLAIM node that is not reachable from a changed fact, and
never touch the graph's structure (edges, registrations) at all - the only
mutation is flipping ``status`` on the WorkItem/Claim objects the walk
actually reaches.

    Per changeset kind:

    * ``UNCHANGED`` - skipped entirely. Required: an unchanged observation
      must never invalidate anything.
    * ``NEW`` - walked exactly like ``CHANGED`` (not special-cased away).
      A brand-new fact's ``fact_id`` cannot already have any dependents
      registered against it, since nothing could reference an id that did
      not exist until this call - so the walk is guaranteed to find nothing.
      That guarantee is a property of the graph, not something this
      function assumes by skipping NEW outright.
    * ``CHANGED`` - walked, and contributes to ``changed_facts``/``reason``.

    Across the whole batch: a WORK/CLAIM id reachable from more than one
    changed fact (or reachable transitively more than once) appears exactly
    once in the result. ``kept_work_ids`` is every registered WORK id minus
    whatever was invalidated - so it is always accurate even for a batch
    that changes nothing.

    Mutation: the only side effect is setting ``status`` on the WorkItem/
    Claim objects actually reached (``STALE`` / ``INVALIDATED`` - see below).
    Nothing about the graph's structure changes. Calling this repeatedly
    with equivalent input is safe: every mutation just re-sets a field to
    the value it already holds, and no list here is ever appended to across
    calls - each call builds its result from scratch by reading current
    graph state.
