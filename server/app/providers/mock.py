"""Deterministic local engine.

The demo has to run with no API key and no network, and it has to be *slow
enough to interrupt*. This engine composes a grounded answer out of the
retrieved evidence and emits it token by token, with a real ``await`` between
tokens so a barge-in lands between two words rather than after the whole turn.
