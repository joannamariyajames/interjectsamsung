"""Goal tracking.

The brief asks the agent to "cater to different changes in goals without losing
the relevant session context". That means a *stack*, not a single mutable
variable: when the user swerves ("actually, what's the refund policy?") the old
goal is parked, not destroyed, so it can be resumed once the detour is done.

Classification is intentionally rule-based and inspectable. Every decision that
reshapes the stack is surfaced to the UI with the rationale that produced it, so
a judge can see *why* the agent thought the goal changed.
